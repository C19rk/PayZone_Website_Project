# PayZone (Object-Oriented Programming Course Website Project)

## Description
PayZone is a web-based payroll management system designed to help businesses manage employee information, calculate salaries, and track payroll records. The system allows administrators to add employees, manage work hours, compute deductions and net pay, and generate accurate payroll reports. It was built to demonstrate the application of object-oriented programming concepts in a real-world project.

## Backstory
This project was a requirement for our Object-Oriented Programming course, from preliminary to final exams. The assignment required teamwork and the application of web development and object-oriented programming concepts to create a workable payroll management website. We had to learn how to collaborate as a team on a more complex software development task while integrating both frontend and backend functionality.

## Contributions
Matt Kerby Perez (Leader) - Coordinated the group, shared ideas with Clark that helped shape the website, polished frontend design, fixed code structuring, added wallpaper and styling to webpages, made the UI look professional, assisted with backend code integration, bug fixer, debugger, pushed the project to GitHub every time we needed to submit it, prepared the progress report, and communicated with the professor regarding project submission timelines as a responsible leader.

Clark Neal Manuntag (Member) – Implemented the login and registration functionality, shared ideas with Matt Kerby that helped shape the website, and developed warning and error messages (e.g., invalid login credentials, dashboard access restrictions). Created PayZone’s logo, animated logo, favicon, and hamburger icon, suggested fonts, assisted in frontend design of most webpages, added logout confirmation, loading screens, animations, bug fixer, and debugger. Lastly, handled deployment (initially on PythonAnywhere).

Note: The PythonAnywhere URL for this project is no longer available because of me deleting it while trying to deploy the In-Bang Website Project when it was the second semester. Thia project can still be viewed locally by cloning or downloading it as zip.
